### Projects
ARbot - A custom Discord bot designed specifically for a Discord server centred around a ROBLOX Flight Simulator. The source code is not publically available at the time of writing this.
Built on Discord.js - http://wwww.discord.js.org

HomeHub - An iPad app designed to allow us to control smart lights without having to use voice assistants or the Home app directly. Planning to add translations to the app. Targeted towards iOS 9.3.5 to allow it to run on a spare iPad.
